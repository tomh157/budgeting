**Test Plan for Budgeting App**

*Budget Tab*

AUTOMATED TEST CASES

Scenario: Testing that adding an income to budget works correctly
  Given I am on the modus budget app in the Budget tab
  And I add an Income of 100
  When I click the Add button
  Then I expect the entry to be added with the correct details
  And I expect the total inflow to increase
  And the working balance should increase

Scenario Outline: Test validation in Value field
  Given I am on the modus budget app in the Budget tab
  When I type a non-numeric <characters> into the value field
  Then the Add button is disabled
      Examples:
        |characters|
        |@!$Â£     |
        |AbYz     |
        |123      |
*This test will fail in the third example with a useful error message 'Add button is not disabled'. This way we also test that the numeric characters enable the Add button*

Given I am on the modus budget app in the Budget tab
